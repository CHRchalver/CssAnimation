        <div>Do you want a career with a future? You should add regular updates to your skills and knowledge. Unless, you have already decided that your current skills and job are good enough for your future.
    
            Knowledge is power, especially in the current job market. Documentation of your skills enables you to move upwards in your organization.
    
            Getting a certificate proves your commitment to upgrade your skills, gives you the credibility needed for more responsibilities, larger projects, and a higher salary.
    
            In addition, documented knowledge is often the key factor when hiring new personnel. Your certificate might advance your career or help you to start a new one.
    
            Also have in mind that employees with certifications increase their company's chances of retaining old and getting new customers. You will do your company a favor getting certified. Expect your company to support you in this.
